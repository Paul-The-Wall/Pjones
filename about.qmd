## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University, pursuing a dual major in Statistics and Economics with a minor in Accounting. Pending my current application, I plan to attend Case for one more year to complete a Master's degree in Accounting.

My interests include video games, watching the NFL, reading, working, and spending time with my fianc√©e.
